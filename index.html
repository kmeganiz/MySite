        <h3>Front-end Developer</h3>
        <p>I have 16 years of experience in graphic design including social media marketing.<br />

          My key strength is having a good sense of design. <br />

          I have a vast knowledge of design software such as Adobe InDesign, Photoshop, and Illustrator. I want to apply this skill to do the process of front-end development, to achieve the desirable
          customers' product. </p>

        <p>I have started a new adventure with Generation Singapore, currently reskilling in the SGUP-CT Microsoft Tech Program, Junior Full Stack Developer coding Bootcamp, as part of #GetReadySG.<br />

          I’m excited to learn Web Development, JavaScript, Java and other employability skills during the 9-months Bootcamp and apprenticeship!<br />

        <h3>Soft-skill</h3>
        <p>My other key strength is also leadership skills which I carried out in the Boot Camp to assertively shared my ideas with my team. <br />

          As a social media executive, I have helped my ex-company to do the switch changes from onsite fundraising events to be virtual in a given short time. I have been trained to stay-ahead to use new tools and software. I would say that I am
          ready to feed my hunger to gain more knowledge and skill. When I worked for the publishing company, I produced more than 100 books and a few of them are best-sellers.</p>

      <h2>Get In Touch</h2>
      <h3>Second chance after breast cancer,<br /> live to the fullest,<br /> choose green for cancer free lifestyle.</h3>

      <!-- <img class="contact-img" src="images/contact.png" alt="contact"> -->
      <p class="contact-message">My biggest challenge was when I was diagnosed with breast cancer on April 2016. I had no money for treatment and was fired by the company. I have always been insecure and felt that no one loves me, especially after
        going through two
        failed relationships. But after being diagnosed, people around me showed love and even went to the extent of fundraising for me.<br />

        This made me realise that I was not alone and that I am loved, allowing me to be more aware of my surroundings and take care of myself better. <br />
