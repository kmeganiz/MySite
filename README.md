<h1>Foundation Project - MySite<h1>
<br>
<h3 color="blue">In this project I purely use HTML and CSS without Flex nor Bootstrap</h3><br>
<br>
<p>As a beginner, I have to build a strong foundation in my full-stack developer. So I started with HTML.<br>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) as the most basic building block of the Web and in this <i>MySite</i> I also include a little CSS to style my HTML document.</p>
