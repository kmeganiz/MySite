#Foundation Project - MySite#
<br>
<br>
In this project purely use HTML and CSS without Flex nor Bootstrap<br>
<br>
As a beginner, I have to build a strong foundation in my full-stack developer. So I started with HTML.<br>
HTML (HyperText Markup Language) as the most basic building block of the Web and in this <i>MySite</i> I also include a little CSS to style my HTML document.
